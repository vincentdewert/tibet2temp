Don't remove the file <JavaSource/log4j4ibis.xml>. This file deviates from the original in the iaf jar to:

	1) exclude AuditLog, ApplicationLog and ErrorLog records from the log files
	2) write TIBCO file system logging to separate log files


Don't replace the file <WebContent/jsp/testPipeLine.jsp>. This file deviates from the original to draw the users attention to use the function 'Send Tibco Message' instead of 'Test a PipeLine'.
